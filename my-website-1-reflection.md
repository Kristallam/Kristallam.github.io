To create a repository, you want to go to GitHub.com and to your profile. At the top right you will see "+", click that and select create repository. Then it will prompt you to your new repository, name it and give it correct permissions then click the green "Create Repository". You have no created your repository! Look for the picture of the clipboard with the arrow pointing at it to clone the URL. Then select the location you want to clone it and click "Clone"

Open soruce means that anyone can edit, download, modify, give, share software, website, etc...

I personally really like Open Source because it gives people a space to explore, create freely. I think that it could be dangerous but then so can anything. So to me Open Source feels like a utopia.

The importance of licenses is because copyright is automatic in the US cand licencing will help and protect you.

Some concepts that were solidfied in the challenge was creating a branch and then pushing it up to the master file. Some aha moments was when I added the index through sublime, saved it and then pushed it up using terminal. I still had some issues merging the files using GitHub and then making sure to fetch and merge it in terminal.

I used https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/ to help me better understand how to clone a repository in a not super technical way.
