          <p>A little about me...</p>
          <p>I have always been interested in technology. As I grew up I realized that I should turn my interest and hobby into a career. Currently I work at Axcient, a disaster recovery company. Where I manage the support team and handle high priority escalations. My career aspirations is to become a Product Manager, overseeing a team of engineers and creating a product that will impact people. I decided to do DBC so I can gain more coding skills to be able to managing a team of engineers as well as start my own company in the future. Something quirky about me is that I love to quote movies just to see if anyone else around me know  which movie Iâ€™m talking about.</p>
