      <h1>RUBY</h1>
      <h2>Ruby Basics</h2>
      <p>GLOBAL VARIABLE - $hello / INSTANCE VARIABLE - @hello / CLASS VARIABLE - @@hello / P - returns the evaluated code AND print to the console / PUTS - returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line / PRINT - nil and prints the output to the console / COMPARING STRINGS - Ruby compares their lexicographical ordering, which means the order they appear in a dictionary / || - OR / FLOATS - decimal numbers // INTEGERS - whole numbers </p>
      <h2>Ruby Arrays</h2>
      <p>ARRAY - are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object / New Array can be created by [] or Array.new / You can access an array by using [], for example accessing an array from the first element would be array[0] ALWAYS START WITH 0 / EACH METHOD - allows us to do something to each object the array points to ex. languagues.each do |lang| / ITERATORS - methods that ac like loops that goes through an array / PUSH - adds object / << - pushes the given object on to the end of this array / POP - removes object</p>
      <h2>Ruby Hashes</h2>
      <p> HASH - collection of unique keys and their values, where an Array uses integers as its index, a HASH allows you to use a object type / HASHES CAN BE CREATED - grades = {"Jane Doe" => 10, "John Doe" => 6} / ALSO CAN WRITE grade = {"Jane Doe": 10, "John Doe": 10 / HASHES have default value that it reutrns when accessing keys that do not exist in the hash, you can set a defauly value by doing grades = Hash.new(0)</p>
      <h2>Ruby Class</h2>
      <p>CLASSES - in ruby are first-class objects, each is an instance of class / When a new class is created, an object of type Class is initalized and assigned to a global constant / INSTANCE VAR - an object's variable, an object;s instance variables will last as long as the object does, they use @ in front of their names / INITALIZE - you call it after you call your calss with def initalize</p>

      <h1>JavaScript</h1>
      <h2>JavaScript Objects</h2>
      <p>OBJECTS has properties associated with it. A PROPERTY of an object cna be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. Object propertiies are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables / Object have properities associated to it</p>
      <h2>JavaScript Loops</h2>
      <p>do ... while LOOP - repeats until a specific condition evaluates to false / while LOOP - executes its statements as long as a specific condition evalutes to true / LABEL Statement - provies a statement with an identifer that lets you refer to it elsewhere in your program / BREAK Statement - to terminate a loop, switch, or in conjunction with a label statement / for ... in statement - interates a specific variable over all the enumerable properties of an object / for ... of statement - creates a loop iterating over iterable objects, invoking a customer iteration hook</p>
      <h2>JavaScript Functions</h2>
      <p>FUNCTIONS are followed by ... the name of the function, a list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and seperated by commas, the JS statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets / fucntion square(number){}</p>
