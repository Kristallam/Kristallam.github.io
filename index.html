        <p>A little about me...</p>
        <p>I have always been interest in technology, when I was a kid I remember spending hours on my computer searching how to mod things and add cool features to websites. As I grew up I realized that I should turn my interest and hobby into a career. The search to find something you love to do in technology isn't easy, the industry is big and there are so many different opportunities. This website will give you a better look into some projects I have done, some passions of mine, and some journeys I have been on.</p>
