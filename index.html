        <p>A little about me...</p>
        <p>I have always had an interest in technology. As I grew up I realized that I should turn my interest and hobby into a career. The search to find something I loved to do in technology wasn't easy, the industry is vast and there are so many different opportunities. This website will give you a better look into some projects I have done, some passions of mine, and some journeys I have been on.</p>
