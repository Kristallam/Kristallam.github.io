What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
  I learned that CSS Padding. boarders, and margin really help move things around on the site. These are what create space between your image/text/display.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?
  I learned CSS position changes a lot of things at once. If you position something wrong then it can change how the whole page looks like.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
  Making the circle on my website was really hard. I thought it was going to be easy to make but that probably took me the longest to do. I think easiest to implement was the font, size, but when you have to adjust shapes it gets hard.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
  Adding formatting elements is pretty complicated. For me, it was a lot of trial and error. I had to play around with a lot of the sizes, width, height to get it right.
